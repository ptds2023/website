## 1. Installing `R` and `RStudio` 

### 1.1 Installing `R`

Install the latest version of `R` (4.2.1 as of June 23, 2022). `R` itself is similar to an engine and chassis of a car, that is a bare minimum so that you can start driving. You need to follow steps below: 

* Visit [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org) and click on "Download R for ...", where ... coresponds to your operating system. 
* Depending on the operating system: 
  - For Mac: download "R-4.2.1.pkg", open this file, and install `R`
  - For Windows: click on "base", download the .exe file, open it, and install `R`
  
*Check yourself:* Open `R` application. In the console you will see something as follows:

```{toml}
R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23) -- "Funny-Looking Kid"
Copyright (C) 2022 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)

Tapez 'q()' pour quitter R.
```

*Note:* If you are a Mac user and you see similar to the following warning messages during the startup

```{toml}
During startup - Warning messages:
1: Setting LC_CTYPE failed, using "C"
2: Setting LC_COLLATE failed, using "C"
3: Setting LC_TIME failed, using "C"
4: Setting LC_MESSAGES failed, using "C"
5: Setting LC_PAPER failed, using "C"
[R.app GUI 1.50 (6126) x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0]

WARNING: You're using a non-UTF8 locale, therefore only ASCII characters will work. Please read R for Mac OS X FAQ (see Help) section 9 and adjust your system preferences accordingly. [History restored from /Users/nemo/.Rapp.history]
```

you need to follow [steps below](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9689104/installing-r-on-mac-warning-messages-setting-lc-ctype-failed-using-c): 

* Open Terminal
* Write or paste in: `defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8`
* Close Terminal

### 1.2 Installing RStudio

*Caution:* Install `RStudio` only once `R` has been installed and only in this order.

`RStudio` is an integrated development environment for `R`. Following up our example of the car, `RStudio` is similar to additional parts, such as exterior, interior, air conditioner, etc. You can drive the vehicle without them, but life is much simpler and pleasant if they are present.

We will install the free version: 
 
* Visit [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
* Click on the respective version of your operating system, this will start the downloading process.
* Open the file and install.

*Note:* To improve the quality of the code, we will limit the length of lines to 80 symbols. To display the margin in RStudio sourse editor:

* Open RStudio
* Go to Tools -> Global Options… -> Code -> Display
* Click on “Show margin”
* Set "Margin column" to 80

*Check yourself:* Open `RStudio` application. In the console you will see something as follows:

```{toml}
R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23) -- "Funny-Looking Kid"
Copyright (C) 2022 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing

```

### 1.3 Installing packages

*Note:* Packages can be installed from both `R` and `RStudio`. The installed `RStudio` is not required.

In this course we will utilize a number of packages. If a package is published on CRAN, then the procedure of installing the package is straightforward: 

* Open RStudio
* In the console execute the following command: `install.packages("package_name")`, where `package_name` is the name of the desired package (e.g., "ggplot2").

Several packages, however, would have only development version (or simply be not published on CRAN). Then, knowing the GitHub link to the repo, one could follow the steps below:

* Install `devtools` package (if it has not yet been installed) as usual (as shown above).
* Type `devtools::install_github("username/repo")` and hit the Enter/return key to execute the command in the console, where `username` is the username of the owner of the repo, and `repo` is the name of the repo.

For homework you will use the following packages from CRAN: `"tidyverse"`, `"rworldmap"`, `"rworldxtra"`, `"ggmap"`, `"highcharter"`, `"devtools"`, `"rmarkdown"`, `"knitr"`, `"xml2"`, `"rvest"`, `"magrittr"`, `"shiny"`, `"roxygen2"`, and `"miniUI"`. 

*Note:* Before installing the `"devtools"` package, you will most certainly need to install building tools.
For Windows, you need to install [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
For Mac, you need to install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
Check this [link](https://r-pkgs.org/setup.html#setup-tools) for more details.

Instead of installing these packages one by one, you can pass the vector of characters packages' names: 


```{toml}
pkgs = c("tidyverse", "rworldmap", "rworldxtra", "ggmap", "highcharter", "devtools", "rmarkdown", "knitr", "xml2", "rvest", "magrittr", "shiny", "roxygen2","miniUI")
install.packages(pkgs = pkgs)
```

Additionally, one has to install [Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley)'s `"emo"` package (i.e., by using `devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")`).

*Note:* Packages should be installed only **once**. No needs to install them every time when you want to use them (it is the same as installing Skype every time you want to call your parents). That is why it is better to do it in console, not in source editor.

*Check yourself:* [To check if a package was installed successfully](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9341635/check-for-installed-packages-before-running-install-packages), use `"name_of_package" %in% rownames(installed.packages())`.

## 2. Installing and setting up Git, GitHub, and a Git GUI

In this section we will install a distributed version-control system Git, register a new user at GitHub and connect them together.

### 2.1 Installing and setting up Git

* Download Git installer [for Mac](http://git-scm.com/download/mac) or [for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
* Open the downloaded file and follow the proposed steps
* Configure your Git to let it know who you are:
  ```{toml}
  git config --global user.name "YOUR FULL NAME"
  git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
  ```
  Please do use your UNIL email address, so that we can exploit GitHub Student Developer Pack afterwards.


*Check yourself:* Type in Terminal: `git --version`. It should display Git version, (e.g., `git version 2.22.0`)

*Note:* For Mac users, Git could be already preinstalled. However, Apple does not provide the latest version, that is why we have just installed the latest Git. If the previous command shows `git version 2.7.0 (Apple Git-66)`, we will need to change the path of the executable command `git`. To do so execute the following commands in Terminal:

```{toml}
cd ~ 
touch .bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:${PATH}"' >> .bash_profile
source .bash_profile
```

*Note:* Sometimes RStudio has a wrong path to `git` command. To check it, go to Tools -> Global Options... -> Git/SVN, check the box "Enable version control interface for RStudio projects". Then, "Git executable" and `which git`/`where git` (for Mac/Windows users, respectively) should be the same. Otherwise, copy the path from Terminal to RStudio.

To check if it worked, type `which git` in Terminal and expect to see `/usr/local/bin/git`.

### 2.2 Registering a GitHub account

* Visit <https://github.com> and fill in the fields. Please use the same email (i.e., UNIL email) address and short username without special symbols like hyphen, periods, etc. Furthermore, use free plan.
* Set up an SSH connection follow steps at <https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent> and <https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account>

* Set up a GitHub Student Developer Pack by visiting <https://education.github.com/>.

### 2.3 Installing and setting up a Git GUI

* Visit [https://desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com) and download GitHub Desktop
* Install it
* Fill in your username and password

You can also consider [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) as an alternative to GitHub Desktop.
